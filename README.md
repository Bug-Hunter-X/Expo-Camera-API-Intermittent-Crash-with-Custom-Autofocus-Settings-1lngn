# Expo Camera API Intermittent Crash with Custom Autofocus Settings

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where setting custom autofocus parameters leads to intermittent crashes or freezes of the camera. The camera stops producing any output.

## Problem Description

When using the Expo Camera API with customized `autoFocus` settings (e.g., setting `autoFocus` to `on` and specifying focus parameters), the camera may occasionally freeze or crash, resulting in the app being unable to capture images or video. This issue is unpredictable and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the project using Expo Go.
3. Toggle between different camera settings, especially those involving custom autofocus parameters.
4. Observe that the camera sometimes freezes or crashes, leading to a loss of camera output.

## Solution

The provided `cameraBugSolution.js` demonstrates one way to potentially mitigate the issue.  It's important to note that there is not a definitive fix for this seemingly intermittent problem.  Strategies that seem to reduce frequency include:

* Using `autoFocus` sparingly and only when absolutely necessary.
* Careful testing and error handling around camera usage.  Gracefully handle potential exceptions.
* If possible, stick to the default `autoFocus` behaviour provided by Expo.
* Consider adding robust error handling and logging to monitor the frequency and conditions under which this occurs.

This bug's reproducibility is inconsistent.  Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause.
